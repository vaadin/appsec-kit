# AppSec Kit

AppSec Kit offers seamless security integration into the development of your Vaadin-based applications. It provides comprehensive dependency visibility, earlier remediation of vulnerabilities, and fewer false positives. It lets you visualize details on found vulnerabilities and store your analysis to share with other developers.
